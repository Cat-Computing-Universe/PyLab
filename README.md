# PyLab: An in-browser Python environment for Data Science 
A **totally, totally, totally** no-install, no-download, no-config in-browser scientific computing platform based on Python. 

Please visit this website for demo:

[CCU, CAT Computing Universe](https://cat-computing-universe.github.io/PyLab/)

## Life is short. Use Python. 
PyLab natively supports Python, and all great science computing packages in it: Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Pytorch(\*), Tensorflow(\*), etc. 

## Demos
* [REPL Playground](https://bboczeng.github.io/PyLab/demo/repl.html)
